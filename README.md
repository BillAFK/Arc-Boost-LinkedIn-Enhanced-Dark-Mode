# Arc-Boost-LinkedIn-Enhanced-Dark-Mode
LinkedIn's Dark mode is great, but as a designer, there's just some things I would do differently. This boost for the Arc browser is an exploration into that.

Some things to know:
  • This is a "Boost" for Linkedin.com on the Arc Browser. 
  • To use this boost, it is probably easier to go to the '+' in the bottom right of the browser, select new style boost, and then add            Linkedin.com as the URL
  
 • from there, copy and past the code from the style sheet to your new file.
 • there are some extras that are included in this boost that go beyond making a better dark mode.
    • The Messages page has been altered to be a more focused experience
    • The Trending panel on the home screen has been removed
    • and basically ever opportunity for Premiu upselling has been removed. 
  **IF YOU DONT WANT ANY OF THESE EXTRAS, PLEASE COMMENT OUT THAT PART OF THE CSS**
